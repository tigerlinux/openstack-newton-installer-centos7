0.1.0.el7 - November 11, 2016

- First beta version of our openstack Installer for OpenStack 
  NEWTON (Release 14).
- All modules are using now the new method for accesing RabbitMQ,
  but the old configuration items still in place "just in case" 
  (you'll see some deprecation warnings in your log files).
- General adaptations to all modules in order to use Newton packages
  for centos and ubuntu (where apply).
- Some old deprecated configs (commented) are still in the scripts.
  We'll clean all this mess before the first non-beta version is
  released.
- Ceilometer and Aodh API's moved to apache wsgi (like keystone).
