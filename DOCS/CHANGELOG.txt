1.1.1.el7 - June 06, 2017

- Added extra code in database installation. This
  new code ensure proper file descriptor settings
  for mariadb.
- Added missing services on cinder installation
  module.

1.1.0.el7 - March 3, 2017

- Major changes on cinder install module. Added the needed
  config and code items to allow the installer to install
  and configure more complex cinder setups with multiple
  dedicated storage nodes and a dedicated cinder controller
  server, or, a default all-in-one cinder server with
  optional cinder dedicated storage nodes.
- Added a variable in our config file to change the default
  measurement time in ceilometer (600 seconds) to any other
  value. This is specially usefull in "autoscaling"
  environments with HEAT.
- Added temporary workaround in neutron install module in
  order to fix conflicting package versions between EPEL
  and Newton RDO Repositories (zeromq packages). Note that
  this workaround only covers the installation, not any
  update. In order to correctly update (while the problem
  is solved by either RDO or EPEL), you'll have to exclude
  all zeromq packages from the "yum update" command.

1.0.6.el7 - February 10, 2017

- Changes and minor corrections in heat. OpenStack
  documentation wrongly states ec2 auth to the keystone
  root url, but it does not work unless /v2.0 is appended
  at the end of the URL.
- Default dhcp lease time on main config set to "-1". This
  sets the lease time to "infinite".

1.0.5.el7 - February 04, 2017

- Corrections in nova install module regarding correct
  variable to assign kvm or qemu as hypervisor.
- Aditional python libraries included on requeriments
  installation module.

1.0.4.el7 - January 27, 2017

  to neutron networks due complete deprecation of nova
  networking.

1.0.3.el7 - January 15, 2017

  suscription control.

1.0.0.el7 - November 25, 2016

- First non-beta release version for our Newton installer.
- Added important information about an aparent bug in horizon
  and it's workaround when manila and/or designate are installed.
- Removed some old deprecated options (but not yet the ones
  related to the messabroker.. that's on purpose).
- Added some extra intelligence to the scripts which creates
  identity items for openstack components (nova, cinder, etc.).
- General cleaning on almost all scripts.

0.2.0.el7 - November 19, 2016

- Corrected entries regarding VPNaaS Neutron agent.

0.1.0.el7 - November 11, 2016

- First beta version of our openstack Installer for OpenStack 
  NEWTON (Release 14).
- All modules are using now the new method for accesing RabbitMQ,
  but the old configuration items still in place "just in case" 
  (you'll see some deprecation warnings in your log files).
- General adaptations to all modules in order to use Newton packages
  for centos and ubuntu (where apply).
- Some old deprecated configs (commented) are still in the scripts.
  We'll clean all this mess before the first non-beta version is
  released.
- Ceilometer and Aodh API's moved to apache wsgi (like keystone).
